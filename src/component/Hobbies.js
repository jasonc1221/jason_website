                <p> One of my greatest passion in life is tennis. 
                    I have been playing tennis since 2010 and have played for my high school (Crescenta Valley High School) and for my college tennis club (Cal Poly Pomona). 
                    I also love cooking Argentine BBQ. I have been cooking it since high school and have been pefecting my skills. 
                    In the side, I help my cousin's business, <a className='App-link' href="https://www.morechimichurri.com">MoreChimichurri</a>, for catering events.
